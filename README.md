# Overview

This is a page that was originally created for games/art I eventually want to get into, but then converted to host longer code/files to make more intricate/interactive/fun Nightbot commands (getting past the Nightbot character limit.)

When I created BenitoiteBot to add even more functionality into Twitch chats, a page of all existing commands for that bot was added on this site as well.

Note that "Gem" is the name I use online.

_The site resulting from this code can be found at [pentagonitestudios.com](https://pentagonitestudios.com/)_

# What is on this site?

Currently, the site is split into two main sections:

- [Nightbot .js Files](https://pentagonitestudios.com/nightbot.html): a page describing all the .js files I have made and are hosting on this site, to be used with Nightbot or any other bot that takes .js code/arrays.

- [BenitoiteBot Commands](https://pentagonitestudios.com/benitoitebot/commands.html): a page describing all current commands in "default" BenitoiteBot, which is a different project I created to have even more bot functionality on Twitch.
